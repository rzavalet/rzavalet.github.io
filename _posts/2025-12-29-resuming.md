# Resuming...

This quick post is to revive my blog. I'll use the opportunity to also add links to some posts that I wrote in the past for other blogs. 

Here they are:

1. [Asi funcionan los Hash Tables](https://bitybyte.github.io/Hashtables/)
2. [Using pgmq with Python](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/pgmq-with-python)
3. [Anatomy of a Postgres extension written in Rust: pgmq](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/postgres-extension-in-rust-pgmq)
4. [Unleashing the power of vector embeddings with PostgreSQL](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/pgvector-and-embedding-solutions-with-postgres)
5. [Vector Indexes in Postgres using pgvector: IVFFlat vs HNSW](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/vector-indexes-in-pgvector)
6. [Benchmarking Postgres Vector Search approaches: Pgvector vs Lantern ](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/postgres-vector-search-pgvector-and-lantern)
7. [Pgvector vs Lantern part 2 - The one with parallel indexes](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/postgres-parallel-vector-indexes)
8. [Benchmarking PostgreSQL connection poolers: PgBouncer, PgCat and Supavisor](https://legacy.tembo.io/blog/postgres-connection-poolers)

Hopefully in the coming year I'll have the energy to continue reviving this blog :)
