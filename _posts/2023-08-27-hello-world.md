# Hello world

This is my first blog entry. I'll use this one to experiment with Jekyll and make sure the usual markdown commands are available.

|  This is a column header | This is another collumn header | 
|----|---|
| This is one row | this is the second column in the row |

## This is another section

In this section I am adding an ordered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### This is a subsection

In this subsection I am adding an unordered list:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Now I want to quote a `word`.

And here I am going to write a hello world in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) 
{
  printf("Hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}

```

Let me add a link to my [profile picture in github](https://github.com/rzavalet.png)

And now let me insert my picture below: 

![my picture](https://github.com/rzavalet.png)

Finally, let me use an emoji :joy: [^1]

And that's it. I think this is the basic stuff that I need for now.

**Footnotes:**

[^1]: For this I needed to install jemoji. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27418781/emoji-for-jekyll)
